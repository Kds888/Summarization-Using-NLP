      "a sample cup is filled with the chocolate and placed in the unit which then displays or prints the results.two classic ways of manually tempering chocolate are:• working the molten chocolate on a heat-absorbing surface, such as a stone slab, until thickening indicates the presence of sufficient crystal \"seeds\"; the chocolate is then gently warmed to working temperature.• stirring solid chocolate into molten chocolate to \"inoculate\" the liquid chocolate with crystals (this method uses the already formed crystals of the solid chocolate to \"seed\" the molten chocolate).chocolate tempering machines (or temperers) with computer controls can be used for producing consistently tempered chocolate.\n",
      "the term is also used for combination bars, which are a type of candy bars• chocolate chips are small pieces of chocolate, usually drop-like, which are meant for decoration and baking• pistoles, callets and fèves are small, coin-like or bean-like pieces of chocolate meant for baking and patisserie applications (also see pistole (coin) and fève (trinket))• chocolate blocks are large, cuboid chunks of chocolate meant for professional use and further processing• other, more specialized shapes for chocolate include sticks, curls and hollow semi-sphereschocolate is very sensitive to temperature and humidity.\n",
      "white chocolate contains cocoa butter, sugar, and milk, but no cocoa solids.chocolate is one of the most popular food types and flavors in the world, and many foodstuffs involving chocolate exist, particularly desserts, including cakes, pudding, mousse, chocolate brownies, and chocolate chip cookies.\n",
      "chocolate is also used in cold and hot beverages, such as chocolate milk and hot chocolate, and in some alcoholic drinks, such as creme de cacao.although cocoa originated in the americas, west african countries, particularly côte d'ivoire and ghana, are the leading producers of cocoa in the 21st century, accounting for some 60% of the world cocoa supply.with some two million children involved in the farming of cocoa in west africa, child slavery and trafficking associated with the cocoa trade remain major concerns.\n",
      "[20]known as \"dutch cocoa\", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when, in 1847, english chocolatier joseph fry discovered a way to make chocolate more easily moldable when he mixed the ingredients of cocoa powder and sugar with melted cocoa butter.\n",
      "which are coated in chocolate.chocolate is used as a flavouring product in many desserts, such as chocolate cakes, chocolate brownies, chocolate mousse and chocolate chip cookies.\n",
      "a \"cocoa product\" is defined as a food product that is sourced from cocoa beans and contains \"cocoa nibs, cocoa liquor, cocoa mass, unsweetened chocolate, bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, cocoa, low-fat cocoa, cocoa powder, or low-fat cocoa powder\".the penultimate process is called conching.\n",
      "in general, molten chocolate coming in at 40–50 °c is cooled in heat exchangers to crystallization temperates of about 26–30 °c, passed through a tempering column consisting of spinning plates to induce shear, then warmed slightly to re-melt undesirable crystal formations.chocolate is molded in different shapes for different uses:[77]• chocolate bars (tablets) are rectangular blocks of chocolate meant to be broken down to cubes (or other predefined shapes), which can then be used for consumption, cooking and baking.\n",
      "much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, which combines chocolate with sugar.the traditional types of chocolate are dark, milk and white.\n",

      "[8]an early classic-period (460–480 ad) maya tomb from the site in rio azul had vessels with the maya glyph for cocoa on them with residue of a chocolate drink, which suggests that the maya were drinking chocolate around 400 ad.\n",
      "[14] in contrast to the maya, who liked their chocolate warm, the aztecs drank it cold, seasoning it with a broad variety of additives, including the petals of the cymbopetalum penduliflorum tree, chili pepper, allspice, vanilla, and honey.the aztecs were unable to grow cocoa themselves, as their home in the mexican highlands was unsuitable for it, so chocolate was a luxury imported into the empire.\n",
      "high-quality white chocolate couverture contains only about 35% cocoa butter.producers of high-quality, small-batch chocolate argue that mass production produces bad-quality chocolate.\n",
      "[72][73] the uniform sheen and crisp bite of properly processed chocolate are the results of consistently small cocoa butter crystals produced by the tempering process.the fats in cocoa butter can crystallize in six different forms (polymorphous crystallization).\n",
      "[114] despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the ivory coast are unaware of the uses of the beans; the high cost of chocolate products in the ivory coast make it inaccessible to the majority of the population, who do not know what it tastes like.\n",
      "[33] milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 swiss chocolatier daniel peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by henri nestlé with the liquor.\n",
      "approximately 65% of the fat in milk chocolate is saturated, mainly palmitic acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table).100-grams of milk chocolate is an excellent source (over 19% of the daily value, dv) of riboflavin, vitamin b12 and the dietary minerals, manganese, phosphorus and zinc.\n",

      "much of the chocolate consumed today is in the form of sweet chocolate, a combination of cocoa solids, cocoa butter or added vegetable oils, and sugar.\n",
      "unfortunately, these spices tended to unsettle the european constitution; the encyclopédie states, \"the pleasant scent and sublime taste it imparts to chocolate have made it highly recommended; but a long experience having shown that it could potentially upset one's stomach\", which is why chocolate without vanilla was sometimes referred to as \"healthy chocolate\".\n",

      "[13] a few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cocoa butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality.\n",
      "plain (or dark) chocolate, as it name suggests, is a form of chocolate that is similar to pure cocoa liquor, although is usually made with a slightly higher proportion of cocoa butter.\n",
      "they associated chocolate with quetzalcoatl, who, according to one legend, was cast away by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans,[13] and identified its extrication from the pod with the removal of the human heart in sacrifice.\n",
      "the chocolate is then heated to about 31 °c (88 °f) to eliminate any type iv crystals, leaving just type v. after this point, any excessive heating of the chocolate will destroy the temper and this process will have to be repeated.\n",
      "chocolate bars, either made of solid chocolate or other ingredients coated in chocolate, are eaten as snacks.\n",

      "numerous types of candy and snacks contain chocolate, either as a filling (e.g., m&m's) or as a coating (e.g., chocolate-coated raisins or chocolate-coated peanuts).some non-alcoholic beverages contain chocolate, such as chocolate milk, hot chocolate, chocolate milkshakes and tejate.\n",
      "[65] some mass-produced chocolate contains much less cocoa (as low as 7% in many cases), and fats other than cocoa butter.\n",
      "the shell is removed to produce cocoa nibs, which are then ground to cocoa mass, unadulterated chocolate in rough form.\n",
      "this causes the surface of the chocolate to appear mottled and matte, and causes the chocolate to crumble rather than snap when broken.\n",

      "[25]the baker chocolate company, which makes baker's chocolate, is the oldest producer of chocolate in the united states.\n",
      "[75]the temperature in which the crystals obtain enough energy to break apart from their rigid conformation would depend on the milk fat content in the chocolate and the shape of the fat molecules, as well as the form of the cocoa butterfat.\n",

      "once heated, the crystals of the polymorphic cocoa butter can break apart from the rigid structure and allow the chocolate to obtain a more fluid consistency as the temperature increases – the melting process.\n",
      "[56]the three main varieties of cocoa beans used in chocolate are criollo, forastero, and trinitario.cocoa pods are harvested by cutting them from the tree using a machete, or by knocking them off the tree using a stick.\n",
