# Summarization-Using-NLP
It contains various methods that we can use to summarize a given text.

    FREQUENCY-BASED-SUMMARIZER
The first method that we are using is Frequency based summarizer, refer the notebook for preprocessing of text and getting the data from the internet of user given text.

    LUNH-ALGO-BASED-SUMMARIZER
    
The second method that we are using is Lunh-Algo based summarizer, refer the notebook for preprocessing of text and getting the data from the internet of user given text, the way for calculating the scores in this is a bit different. We take the most important words in a text, by taking in account of their frequency then, based of their frequency we calculate the score like, imp_words**2/total_numer_of_words_in_a_sentence, Making use of this formulae we assign scores to each of the sentences given to us.
